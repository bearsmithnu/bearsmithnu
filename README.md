## Hello, I'm Bear.
My interests CS-wise are systems, networks, cybersecurity, and generally anything low-level enough that you don't think about it until it stops working.
I appreciate the administration and maintenance of something built well.
I have a personal disinterest in generative AI.

Offline, I also take interest in accounting, the humanities, painting, and a variety of the "domestic hobbies" that have kept the world fed and clothed for millenia.
